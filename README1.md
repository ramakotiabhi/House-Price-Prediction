# THE AIM OF TASK

House price prediction is a common and crucial task in the real estate industry. Predicting house prices accurately can help buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals make informed decisions. Machine learning models, built using popular libraries like scikit-learn and TensorFlow in Python, can be effective in predicting house prices based on various features.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can predict house prices based on relevant features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, and other factors. The dataset used for training and testing the model should contain historical information on houses, including their features and corresponding sale prices.

## ELEMENTS OF TASK

**COMMANDS USED:**

 The process to develop a machine learning model for predicting house prices using Python, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. 

1. **Import Libraries**  : Import necessary libraries

         *import numpy as np*
         *import pandas as pd*
         *from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split*
         *from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler*
         *from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression*
         *from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error*
         *import tensorflow as tf*
         *from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential*
         *from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense*

we import the necessary libraries. NumPy and pandas are used for data manipulation, scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms, and TensorFlow for building neural networks.

2. **Data Collection** : Obtain a dataset containing information about houses, including features like the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, etc.

3. **DataPreprocessing** :  
Handle missing data by either removing or imputing values.
Encode categorical variables if necessary.
Scale numerical features to ensure they have similar ranges.      
 Example: Handling missing values and scaling numerical features

         *df.fillna(0, inplace=True)*
         *scaler = StandardScaler()*
         *df[['num_bedrooms', 'square_footage']] = scaler.fit_transform(df[['num_bedrooms', 'square_footage']])*          

4. **Load and Explore Data** : Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of features.
Visualize relationships between different features and the target variable (house prices).
Identify outliers and decide whether to remove or handle them.

         *Load your dataset*
         *data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')*

Explore your data

         *print(data.head())*
         *print(df.info())*

5. **Preprocess Data** : Split the data into features (X) and the target variable (y). Then, split the dataset into training and testing sets. Standardize the features using StandardScaler from scikit-learn.

Assume 'price' is your target variable

         *X = data.drop('price', axis=1)*
         *y = data['price']*

Split the data into training and testing sets

         *X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)*

Standardize the features

         *scaler = StandardScaler()*
         *X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)*
         *X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)*

6. **Train a Linear Regression Model** : Create a Linear Regression model, train it on the training set, make predictions on the test set, and evaluate the model's performance using mean squared error.

Initialize the model

         *model_lr = LinearRegression()*

Train the model

         *model_lr.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)*

Make predictions on the test set

         *predictions_lr = model_lr.predict(X_test_scaled)*

Evaluate the model

         *mse_lr = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions_lr)*
         *print(f'Mean Squared Error (Linear Regression): {mse_lr}')*

7. **Train a Neural Network Model using TensorFlow** : Create a Neural Network model using TensorFlow's Keras API. Specify the architecture, compile the model with an optimizer and loss function, train it on the training set, and evaluate its performance on the test set using mean squared error.

         *Initialize the model*
         *model_nn = Sequential()*
         *model_nn.add(Dense(64, input_dim=X_train_scaled.shape[1], activation='relu'))*
         *model_nn.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))*
         *model_nn.add(Dense(1))*

Compile the model

         *model_nn.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')*

Train the model

         *model_nn.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, verbose=2)*

Make predictions on the test set

         *predictions_nn = model_nn.predict(X_test_scaled)*

Evaluate the model

         *mse_nn = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions_nn)*
         *print(f'Mean Squared Error (Neural Network): {mse_nn}')*

8. **Compare Models** 

         *print(f"Random Forest MSE: {mse_rf}")*
         *print(f"Neural Network MSE: {mse_nn}")*

9. **Fine-tune and Optimize** : Experiment with hyperparameter tuning for both models to improve performance. Consider using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search for the Random Forest model.

Example Grid Search for Random Forest

         *from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV*

         *param_grid = {*
         *'n_estimators': [50, 100, 200],*
         *max_depth': [None, 10, 20],*
         *'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10],*
         }*

         *grid_search = GridSearchCV(RandomForestRegressor(random_state=42), param_grid, cv=5, scoring='neg_mean_squared_error')*
         *grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)*

         *best_rf_model = grid_search.best_estimator_*
         *best_predictions_rf = best_rf_model.predict(X_test)*
         *best_mse_rf = mean_squared_error(y_test, best_predictions_rf)*
         *print(f"Best Random Forest MSE: {best_mse_rf}")*

10. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters to optimize its performance.
Consider using techniques like grid search or randomized search.

11. **Model Evaluation**:
Evaluate the final model on the testing dataset to ensure its generalization to new data.
Analyze the model's predictions and residuals.

12. **Deployment (Optional)** :
If applicable, deploy the model for real-world predictions using frameworks like Flask or FastAPI.

13. **Documentation and Reporting**:
Document the entire process, including data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation.
Provide insights into the model's performance and limitations.
